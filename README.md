# Vivecraft-API-Demo

This demo package serves as both a pitch to you as to why the Vivecraft-API is cool and useful, and simultaneously serves as a basic demonstration on how to use the API to enhance pre-existing items for VR players, to add new, VR-unique enhancements to the game not already provided by [Vivecraft Forge Extensions](https://github.com/Techjar/VivecraftForgeExtensions_110), or to create new, VR-exclusive mechanics that may not work well for keyboard and mouse players.
